      <h1>Hello Hello ðŸ˜Ž Gooday to You !</h1>
      <p>I am an aspiring software developer & web-designer living in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
        <p>As a current student in the Thinkful Software Engineering Immersion program, I'm interested in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Developing a good foundation of basic skills and computer languages</li>
          <li>Learning both front-end & back-end web-development</li>
          <li>Having a group of fellow students, teachers, and mentors I can communicate with to further cement the information I'm learning</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Ever since I was a young boy , about 5 years old, I've had an avid interest in computers and video games. I actually started with an old Dos computer. As I grew older the internet became available for me and I discovered a giant fascinating digital world to explore , learn , and have fun in! Thoughts of learning web-design, coding, and software-development roamed through my head all through out my life ever since. I've never fully pursued a career in one of those fields until most recently however . </p>

        <p>As a current student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I hope to realize my dreams of working in this field of computer science and finally find a career for my life ðŸ¤— I love working with other students and teachers because it helps me stay focused , makes the process more enjoyable , and allows me to verbally communicate the knowledge being studied , therefore - solidifying it and having experience actually speaking about it. That helps a lot , because there's a whole real world we have to deal with out there and we can't just be stuck inside our own minds all the time .

        <p>Some of my current hobbies and interest are software development , hiking with my dog , cooking , reading , music , football, and I guess I can go on for a lot more if I wanted. I'm mostly out of the video game world now , though there are a few games out there that fascinate me and I think about trying one day ^^  </p>
